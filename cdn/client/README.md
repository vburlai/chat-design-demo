Client component is a simple web-application which is used to connect to chat servers.

Its task is to work with chat servers to accomplish chat functionality.

We use [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) for this demo because:
 * HTML, SVG, JavaScript and CSS are the only languages understood by all web browsers and do not require extra plugins to be installed
